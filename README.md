## Project Overview
**Healthy Food Game** is an interactive, camera-based classroom prototype that teaches children about **healthy eating and physical activity** through **movement-based play**.  
Players move in front of the camera to **catch falling healthy foods**, earning points and learning nutrition tips in a fun, social way.

Developed for a university **interaction design studio**, the project demonstrates how technology can support **human interaction**, **collaboration**, and **learning through movement**.
